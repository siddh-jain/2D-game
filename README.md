- The game is a top-down one with fixed frame dungeon rooms.

## Description of Project

- Every room contains of randomly generated walls (apart from edge walls).
- Every room contains of randomly spawned coins and enemies.
- Player's points increase on collecting coins whereas the plyer loses on coming in contact with the moving/ static enemies.
